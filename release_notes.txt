Release notes for dnsjnio version 0.9.7
---------------------------------------

o  Added LookupAsynch (thanks Stefano Bagnara!) and LookupAsynchTest.
o  Working version of ExtendedNonblockingResolver (and test code) added.
o  Added non-single-port usage of dnsjnio. Instead of always running on
    the same port (when possible), dnsjnio can now be configured to run 
    a new port for every query (to help prevent spoofing).
o  Header ID (uniqueId) now short as ID is only 16 bits - thanks 
     Norman Maurer!
o  Threads now call setDaemon(true) - thanks Stefano Bagnara!
